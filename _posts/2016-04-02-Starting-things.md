I like starting things. I always have, it's easy, requires little motivation and can mostly be done based on enthusiasm.
One of the things that I have learnt about myself over the last few year however is that I'm terrible at finishing things. A typical example might go like this....

Biddy wakes up, has a great idea for some awesome new thing (insert hobby, activity, sport here).
She dives into awesome new thing.
Time passes (maybe a day, maybe a week, maybe a couple of years).
But eventually she loses interest.
And repeat from above.

Now this has been going on for almost as long as I have been allowed to make decisions for myself.
And as a consequence I've tried a hell of a lot of different things. I played the bagpipes, rode horses, wrote code in numerous different languages, painted - honestly the list goes on.

But I'm between time consuming hobbies at the moment and I've had a bit of time to think about this pattern.
And I think I've figured out the combination of personality traits to blame...

Firstly I have (according to my lovely partner) an obsessive personality, in that I set my mind to something and will pursue it obsessively.

Which is great, except when you combine it with a notoriously short attention span. Say what you will, but I'm a typical example of my generation. Raised with access to so much easy entertainment, I find it hard to concentrate on something for too long. A key example of this, when I was at Uni studying every time I wrote code I did so with an episode of the Simpsons (or some other easy show) playing on my second screen. Now logic says that surely this would make it more difficult to produce meaningful work, but it proved to be the perfect combination of stimulus for me. I'd obsess over a single function, and then watch the show for a couple of minutes and the start on the next function.

Slowly, and without realizing I've conditioned myself to be like this.
I obsess, and then lose attention and move onto the next thing.

So now I'm making a concerted effort to stop, to slow down, focus on one thing at a time and enjoy the focus.

And part of that is this blog, I'm back here, trying to force myself to focus, to stay here and to finish something...
Or at least blog for a couple of months (I'd call that a win!).

Ciao
