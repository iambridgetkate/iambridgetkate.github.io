It's been a rough couple of days for my poor OH, He's had the relative misfortune of teaching me about github, sketch and jekyll.

However it would seem (because here we are) that some things have sunk in!

I'm planning on finishing the site content over the next couple of days, but for now Jekyll Theme = Check.
