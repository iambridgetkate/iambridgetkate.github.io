Once upon a time, approximately twenty four years ago my lovely parents had an adorable wee child, namely me Bridget Kate.
My first lesson learned was probably something purely functional but now I'm twenty four (and a few months) and it seems like I learn something new everyday!

A brief summary:
<li> Country girl living in the capital city.
<li> Working in corporate IT.
<li> Professionally obsessed with web performance optimization.
<li> Novice balcony gardener.
<li> Hobbist Developer.
<li> Lover of the finer things in life, aka trying to live larger than my means.
<li> Coffee Snob (According to my deep south family).
